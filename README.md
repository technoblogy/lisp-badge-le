# Lisp Badge LE
A self-contained low-power computer with its own display and keyboard that you can program in Lisp. It now includes the new features in uLisp Release 4.8f.

The files are as follows:

* LispBadgeLE.ino - the uLisp source file for the Lisp Badge LE.
* LispBadgeLE-comments.ino - identical but including comprehensive comments.

Only use one of these files. It should be compiled and uploaded using the Arduino IDE.
